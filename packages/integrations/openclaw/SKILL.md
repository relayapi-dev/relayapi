# RelayAPI – Unified Social Media API

You have access to RelayAPI, a unified API for managing 21 platforms. Use the `RELAYAPI_API_KEY` environment variable for authentication.

## Authentication

**IMPORTANT — Before making any API call, check that `RELAYAPI_API_KEY` is set in the environment.** If the variable is missing or empty:

1. Tell the user: "The `RELAYAPI_API_KEY` environment variable is not set. You need a RelayAPI API key to use this skill."
2. Guide them to get a key:
   - **Sign up** at https://relayapi.dev/app (free tier available — 200 API calls/month)
   - **Log in** to the dashboard and navigate to **API Keys**
   - **Create a new key** — it will start with `rlay_live_` (production) or `rlay_test_` (testing)
3. Guide them to store it securely using OpenClaw's secrets system (recommended):
   ```bash
   openclaw secrets configure
   ```
   Then set the env var via one of these methods (best to worst):
   - **1Password / Vault** (most secure) — use an `exec` provider to fetch the key at runtime
   - **Secrets file** — store in `~/.openclaw/secrets.json` with restricted file permissions (`chmod 600`)
   - **Environment variable** (least secure) — `export RELAYAPI_API_KEY="rlay_live_..."` in shell profile
4. **Do NOT proceed with any API calls until the key is configured.**
5. **Do NOT ask the user to paste the key directly in chat.**

All requests require:

```
Authorization: Bearer $RELAYAPI_API_KEY
```

Base URL: `https://api.relayapi.dev`

## Supported Platforms (21)

`twitter`, `instagram`, `facebook`, `linkedin`, `tiktok`, `youtube`, `pinterest`, `reddit`, `bluesky`, `threads`, `telegram`, `snapchat`, `googlebusiness`, `whatsapp`, `mastodon`, `discord`, `sms`, `beehiiv`, `convertkit`, `mailchimp`, `listmonk`

## Posting

### Create a Post

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.relayapi.dev/v1/posts \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $RELAYAPI_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "content": "Hello from RelayAPI!",
    "targets": ["twitter", "linkedin"],
    "scheduled_at": "now"
  }'
```

**Parameters:**

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `content` | string | No* | Post text. Optional if every target has content in `target_options`. |
| `targets` | string[] | Yes (min 1) | Where to publish. See "Target Resolution" below. |
| `scheduled_at` | string | Yes | `"now"` = publish immediately, `"draft"` = save as draft, or ISO 8601 datetime (e.g. `"2026-06-01T12:00:00Z"`) to schedule. |
| `media` | array | No | Media attachments: `[{ "url": "https://...", "type": "image" }]`. Type can be `"image"`, `"video"`, `"gif"`, or `"document"`. If omitted, type is inferred from the file extension. |
| `target_options` | object | No | Per-target content overrides. Keys are target values (platform name, account ID, or workspace ID). |
| `timezone` | string | No | IANA timezone for scheduling (default: `"UTC"`). Example: `"America/New_York"`. |
| `workspace_id` | string | No | Scope the post to a specific workspace. If omitted, operates across all workspaces. |

### Target Resolution (3 ways to specify targets)

Targets tell RelayAPI where to publish. You can mix all three types in the same request:

**1. Platform name** — publishes to ALL connected accounts on that platform:
```json
{ "targets": ["twitter"] }
```
If the user has 2 Twitter accounts connected, the post goes to both.

**2. Account ID** — publishes to one specific account:
```json
{ "targets": ["acc_abc123"] }
```
Use `GET /v1/accounts` to find account IDs.

**3. Workspace ID** — publishes to ALL accounts in a group:
```json
{ "targets": ["ws_xyz789"] }
```
Use `GET /v1/workspaces` to find workspace IDs. A group named "Marketing" with a Twitter and Instagram account will publish to both.

**Mixed example:**
```json
{ "targets": ["ws_marketing", "acc_ceo_linkedin", "youtube"] }
```
This publishes to all accounts in the "Marketing" group + the CEO's specific LinkedIn account + all YouTube accounts.

**Error codes for failed targets:**
- `NO_ACCOUNT` — no accounts exist for the platform name
- `ACCOUNT_NOT_FOUND` — the `acc_*` ID doesn't exist in this workspace
- `WORKSPACE_NOT_FOUND` — the `grp_*` ID doesn't exist in this workspace
- `EMPTY_WORKSPACE` — the group exists but has no accounts assigned
- `INVALID_TARGET` — not a valid platform name, account ID, or workspace ID

### Per-Platform Customization

Use `target_options` to override content per target. Keys match target values:

```json
{
  "content": "Default text for all platforms",
  "targets": ["twitter", "linkedin", "instagram"],
  "scheduled_at": "now",
  "target_options": {
    "twitter": { "content": "Short tweet with #hashtags (280 char limit)" },
    "instagram": { "content": "Instagram caption ✨", "first_comment": "#tags #here" },
    "linkedin": { "content": "Professional long-form version..." }
  }
}
```

You can also key by account ID or workspace ID:
```json
{
  "target_options": {
    "acc_abc123": { "content": "Custom for this specific account" },
    "ws_xyz": { "content": "Custom for all accounts in this group" }
  }
}
```

### Media Attachments

**Option 1 — External URL** (simplest):
```json
{
  "content": "Check this out!",
  "targets": ["instagram", "twitter"],
  "scheduled_at": "now",
  "media": [
    { "url": "https://example.com/photo.jpg", "type": "image" }
  ]
}
```

**Option 2 — Upload first, then reference** (more reliable):
```bash
# Get a presigned upload URL
curl -X POST https://api.relayapi.dev/v1/media/presign \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $RELAYAPI_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "filename": "photo.jpg", "content_type": "image/jpeg" }'

# Upload the file to the presigned URL (returned in response)
curl -X PUT "<presigned_url>" \
  -H "Content-Type: image/jpeg" \
  --data-binary @photo.jpg

# Use the media URL in a post
```

**Option 3 — Direct upload:**
```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.relayapi.dev/v1/media/upload?filename=photo.jpg" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $RELAYAPI_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream" \
  --data-binary @photo.jpg
```

### Post Statuses

After creation, a post can be in one of these states:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `draft` | Saved but not scheduled or published |
| `scheduled` | Queued to publish at a future time |
| `publishing` | Currently being sent to platforms (async) |
| `published` | Successfully published to ALL targets |
| `partial` | Published to SOME targets, failed on others |
| `failed` | Failed on ALL targets |

**Important:** When `scheduled_at` is `"now"`, the API returns immediately with status `"publishing"`. The actual publishing happens asynchronously. Always check the post status afterwards or use webhooks to be notified.

### List Posts

```bash
curl "https://api.relayapi.dev/v1/posts?limit=20" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $RELAYAPI_API_KEY"
```

**Query parameters:** `limit` (1-100, default 20), `cursor`, `workspace_id` (optional — scope to a specific workspace), `account_id`, `status` (draft/scheduled/publishing/published/failed/partial), `from` (ISO datetime), `to` (ISO datetime).

### Get Post Details

```bash
curl https://api.relayapi.dev/v1/posts/{post_id} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $RELAYAPI_API_KEY"
```

Response includes per-target status with platform URLs for published targets.

### Update a Post

Only `draft`, `scheduled`, or `failed` posts can be updated.

```bash
curl -X PATCH https://api.relayapi.dev/v1/posts/{post_id} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $RELAYAPI_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "content": "Updated content", "targets": ["twitter", "linkedin"] }'
```

### Delete a Post

```bash
curl -X DELETE https://api.relayapi.dev/v1/posts/{post_id} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $RELAYAPI_API_KEY"
```

### Retry Failed Targets

Re-attempts publishing for targets that failed:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.relayapi.dev/v1/posts/{post_id}/retry \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $RELAYAPI_API_KEY"
```

### Unpublish a Post

Deletes the post from platforms and marks it as cancelled:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.relayapi.dev/v1/posts/{post_id}/unpublish \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $RELAYAPI_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "platforms": ["twitter"] }'
```

Omit `platforms` to unpublish from all. Only works on `published` or `partial` posts.

### Bulk Create Posts

Create up to 50 posts in one request:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.relayapi.dev/v1/posts/bulk \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $RELAYAPI_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "posts": [
      { "content": "Post 1", "targets": ["twitter"], "scheduled_at": "now" },
      { "content": "Post 2", "targets": ["linkedin"], "scheduled_at": "2026-06-01T12:00:00Z" },
      { "content": "Post 3", "targets": ["ws_marketing"], "scheduled_at": "draft" }
    ]
  }'
```

Response includes `summary: { total, succeeded, failed }`.

    "metadata": { "custom_field": "value" }
  }'
```

Set `"workspace_id": null` to remove from a group.

### Disconnect (Delete) Account

```bash
curl -X DELETE https://api.relayapi.dev/v1/accounts/{account_id} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $RELAYAPI_API_KEY"
```

### Account Health

Check if tokens are valid and not expired:

# All accounts
curl https://api.relayapi.dev/v1/accounts/health \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $RELAYAPI_API_KEY"

# Single account
curl https://api.relayapi.dev/v1/accounts/{account_id}/health \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $RELAYAPI_API_KEY"
```

Response: `{ "id", "platform", "username", "healthy": true/false, "token_expires_at", "error"? }`

### Workspaces

Groups let you organize accounts and publish to all of them at once using `grp_*` IDs as targets.

```bash
# List groups
curl https://api.relayapi.dev/v1/workspaces \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $RELAYAPI_API_KEY"

# Create group
curl -X POST https://api.relayapi.dev/v1/workspaces \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $RELAYAPI_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "name": "Marketing Team", "description": "All brand accounts" }'

# Update group
curl -X PATCH https://api.relayapi.dev/v1/workspaces/{workspace_id} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $RELAYAPI_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "name": "Rebranded Team" }'

# Delete group (accounts are ungrouped, not deleted)
curl -X DELETE https://api.relayapi.dev/v1/workspaces/{workspace_id} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $RELAYAPI_API_KEY"

# Assign account to a group
curl -X PATCH https://api.relayapi.dev/v1/accounts/{account_id} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $RELAYAPI_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "workspace_id": "ws_abc123" }'
```

**Workflow example — "publish to Marketing Team":**
1. `GET /v1/workspaces` → find `ws_abc123` named "Marketing Team"
2. `POST /v1/posts` with `"targets": ["ws_abc123"]` → publishes to all accounts in that group

### Platform Sub-Resources

Some platforms require selecting a specific page, org, board, or location after connecting:

```bash
# Facebook Pages
curl https://api.relayapi.dev/v1/accounts/{id}/facebook-pages \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $RELAYAPI_API_KEY"
curl -X PUT https://api.relayapi.dev/v1/accounts/{id}/facebook-pages \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $RELAYAPI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{ "page_id": "123" }'

## Connecting Accounts

### OAuth Flow (most platforms)

This is a 2-step process:

```bash
# Step 1: Get the authorization URL
curl "https://api.relayapi.dev/v1/connect/twitter" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $RELAYAPI_API_KEY"
# Returns: { "auth_url": "https://twitter.com/i/oauth2/authorize?..." }

# Step 2: After user authorizes, exchange the code
curl -X POST https://api.relayapi.dev/v1/connect/twitter \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $RELAYAPI_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "code": "the_auth_code_from_callback" }'
# Returns: { "account": { "id": "acc_...", "platform": "twitter", ... } }
```

**Supported OAuth platforms:** twitter, instagram, facebook, linkedin, tiktok, youtube, pinterest, reddit, threads, snapchat, googlebusiness, mastodon

**For platforms with sub-resources (Facebook, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Google Business, Snapchat):**
After OAuth, you need to select which page/org/board/location:
```bash
# List available pages
curl https://api.relayapi.dev/v1/connect/facebook/pages \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $RELAYAPI_API_KEY"

# Select a page
curl -X POST https://api.relayapi.dev/v1/connect/facebook/pages \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $RELAYAPI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{ "page_id": "123456" }'
```

**Headless OAuth** (for server-side flows):
```bash
curl "https://api.relayapi.dev/v1/connect/twitter?headless=true" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $RELAYAPI_API_KEY"
# Returns auth_url — after callback, retrieve data via (token comes from the callback):
curl "https://api.relayapi.dev/v1/connect/pending-data?token=TEMP_TOKEN" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $RELAYAPI_API_KEY"
```

### Bluesky (app password, no OAuth)

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.relayapi.dev/v1/connect/bluesky \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $RELAYAPI_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "handle": "user.bsky.social", "app_password": "xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx" }'
```

### Telegram (bot code)

```bash
# Initiate — returns a 6-char code and bot username
curl -X POST https://api.relayapi.dev/v1/connect/telegram \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $RELAYAPI_API_KEY"
# Returns: { "code": "ABC123", "bot_username": "@relayapi_bot", "expires_in": 900 }

# Tell the user to message the bot with: /start ABC123

# Poll for connection status
curl "https://api.relayapi.dev/v1/connect/telegram?code=ABC123" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $RELAYAPI_API_KEY"
# Returns: { "status": "pending" | "connected" | "expired" }

# Or connect directly with a known chat ID
curl -X POST https://api.relayapi.dev/v1/connect/telegram/direct \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $RELAYAPI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{ "chat_id": "-100123456789" }'
```

### Connection Logs

```bash
curl https://api.relayapi.dev/v1/connections/logs \

## Tips for AI Agents

- Always check post status after creation — `"now"` publishes asynchronously and the post can end up as `partial` or `failed`.
- Use `target_options` to customize content per platform — different character limits and conventions require different text.
- Use workspace IDs (`grp_*`) when the user refers to a collection of accounts by name.
- Use validation tools before publishing to catch issues early.
- Upload media via presigned URLs for reliability.
- Set up webhooks for real-time notifications instead of polling.
- When the user says "post to X", first check `GET /v1/accounts` or `GET /v1/workspaces` to resolve what "X" means.
- When the user wants stats, use `/v1/analytics/platform/overview` for live data or `/v1/analytics` for historical data.
